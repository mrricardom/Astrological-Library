# Project Overview

## Project Name

The Astrological Library

## Project Description

Through a simple drop-down menu you too can find out which RuPaul's Drag Race Queen you are based on your Astrological sign. Impress your friends, family, lovers, etc. as you whip out the name of your cosmic soul drag-sister. A picture, a quote, and a decription of your shared attributes will be displayed. Start your engines, because the Astrological Library is OPEN!
